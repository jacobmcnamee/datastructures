# Data Structures Library
A collection of data structures implemented in C.

## Tests
Tests found in [test](./test) are automatically built and run using
[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) as part of the default make
target. `make test` can be used to run the tests explicitly.

## Benchmarks
Benchmarks found in [benchmark](./benchmark) are automatically built and run
using [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) when `make bench`
is executed.
